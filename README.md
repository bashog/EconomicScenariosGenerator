# Economic Scenario Generator

## Context

In the context of the "Counterparty Risk" project, which is related to the ability of the counterparty on the OTC markets to meet its commitments such as payment, delivery or repayment, it is essential to manage financial asset portfolios by taking into account different possible scenarios. This is where the 'ESG', an economic scenario generator, comes in to predict different risk factors over a period of several years.  

An ESG consists of a set of models (interest rates, equities, asset yields, credit spreads, inflation, etc.) allowing to randomly simulate possible evolution scenarios of the financial markets, which have an impact on the value and the performance of the assets.
