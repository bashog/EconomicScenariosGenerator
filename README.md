# Economic Scenario Generator

## Context

In the context of the "Counterparty Risk" project, which is related to the ability of the counterparty on the OTC markets to meet its commitments such as payment, delivery or repayment, it is essential to manage financial asset portfolios by taking into account different possible scenarios. This is where the 'ESG', an economic scenario generator, comes in to predict different risk factors over a period of several years.  

An ESG consists of a set of models (interest rates, equities, asset yields, credit spreads, inflation, etc.) allowing to randomly simulate possible evolution scenarios of the financial markets, which have an impact on the value and the performance of the assets. 

## Project motivations and purposes

After the financial crisis of 2008, states realized that economic risks could represent a threat to the community. As a result, stricter measures have been imposed on banks and insurance companies in terms of regulation and economic conduct. Among these measures we cite a better management of risks by modeling its factors. This project  aims to analyze and forecast the exchange rate as our main risk factor.  

Through a GSS we could simulate this variable by being consistent with its past evolutions, i.e. with the dynamics associated with it but also with the evolution of the dependency structure. Parametric or non-parametric methods like bootstrapping can be used, as well as generative machine learning models.
